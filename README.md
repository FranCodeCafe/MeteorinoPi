# MeteorinoPi
MeteorinoPi is a low-cost solar-powered weather station based on Raspberry Pi and Arduino presented as a research project for the Computer Engineer title.
And as you can already guess, it consist of multiple sensors conected to two Arduinos, who send data through serial communication to a Raspberry Pi 3. The RasPi acts as a local server sending the data through Python to a database, that then it's displayed on a web page. 

The components for this project are:

A Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+

2 Arduinos

SparkFun Weather Meters (Anemometer, Wind Vane and Rain Gauge)

SparkFun Weather Shield (Si7021 Humidity sensor, MPL3115A2 Barometric Pressure Sensor and ALS-PT19 Light Sensor)

ML8511 UV Sensor

MG811 CO2 Gas Sensor

DS18B20 Waterproof Temperature Sensor

Sharp Optical Dust Sensor GP2Y1010AU0F

SW420 Vibration Sensor

Based on Ublox NEO-6M GPS Module

LCD 20x4 Display
