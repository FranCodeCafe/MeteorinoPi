# Meteorino
Meteorino is a low-cost weather station based on Raspberry Pi and Arduino presented as a research project for the Computer Engineer title.
And as you can already guess, it consist of multiple sensors conected to two Arduinos, who send data through serial communication to a Raspberry Pi 3. The RasPi acts as a local server sending the data through Python to a database, and then it's displayed on a web page.
